[# SwiftCart | Modern E-Commerce Interface

SwiftCart is a responsive, high-performance tech and lifestyle shopping platform. This project showcases advanced front-end concepts, including dynamic data rendering, multi-conditional filtering, and a modern dashboard layout.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Inventory**: A catalog of 36+ products across categories like Electronics, Appliances, Fashion, Furniture, and Books.
- **Advanced Filtering**: A centralized filtering system allowing users to search by Category, Gender, and Rating simultaneously.
- **Professional Layout**: A "sticky" sidebar navigation with a flexible product grid built using CSS Flexbox.
- **UI/UX Focused**: Interactive elements like hover transformations, dynamic rating stars, and professional product cards.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for better SEO and accessibility.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with Flexbox for a side-by-side dashboard layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Module-based architecture, advanced array filtering methods (`.filter()`), and DOM manipulation.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data.js`: A centralized database of product objects.
- `script.js`: Contains the master filter logic and dynamic rendering functions.
- `style.css`: Modern UI styling and responsive design rules.
- `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.

## 📈 Recent Updates (v3.0)

- **Layout Overhaul**: Replaced the vertical stack with a professional Horizontal Sidebar + Product Grid structure.
- **Smart Categorization**: Implemented specific logic for "Appliances" and "Electronics" to improve user navigation.
- **Unified Filter Logic**: Created a master `applyFilters()` function to handle multiple filter states (Category + Gender + Rating) at once without page refreshes.
- **Inventory Expansion**: Scaled from 12 to 36 products with full metadata.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

SwiftCart is an ongoing project. I am dedicated to continuous improvement and will be rolling out new upgrades and advanced features in future versions to enhance the user experience and platform functionality.
